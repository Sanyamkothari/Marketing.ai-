# Marketing AI

A **reusable marketing AI engine**. A business user selects a use case (e.g. Targeted Advertisement),
uploads a CSV, picks the primary key and target column, and clicks Run. The engine validates the data,
trains the best model with AutoML, evaluates it, explains it, and can later score new data. Results are
shown as a pipeline: **Data → Model → Output**. The engine is generic: each use case is a *configuration
file*, not code. Adding a new use case, or a new industry, means adding config, not features.

Instead of building a separate model per client, we build one engine. Each industry gets a template of
lifecycle stages and use cases. Each client maps their data to a standard format. AutoML trains the best
model on their data. Users can train on historical data or score new data with the approved (champion)
model, and every prediction comes with a reason and a recommended action.

Milestone 1 creates the skeleton: `configs/`, `templates/`, `engine/`, `api/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` and
`docs/`. `ui/` (M5) and `data/` (M2) arrive with later milestones.

---

## Getting started

A clean machine needs only **Python 3.11** and **make**. `uv` is used when it is on `PATH`, and
`python -m venv` + `pip` otherwise.

```bash
make setup     # create .venv, install the project with its dev extra, verify AutoGluon imports
make lint      # ruff + black --check + mypy --strict + the generated-file drift check
make test      # the fast test suite (everything not marked @slow)
make run       # serve the API on http://localhost:8000
make generate  # regenerate templates/ and docs/API.md from the configs and contracts
```

`make setup` ends by importing AutoGluon and printing `setup ok: autogluon.tabular 1.6.3`. If AutoGluon
fails to install, setup stops with a non-zero exit rather than falling back to another library.

Optional extras:

```bash
make setup EXTRAS=nn   # installs .[dev,nn] — adds torch so the NeuralNet family can be selected (DEC-011)
```

Other targets: `make test-all` (every test, including `@slow`), `make format` (apply `ruff --fix` and
`black`), `make check-generated` (fail if `templates/` or `docs/API.md` are stale), `make clean`, and
`make help` to list them all.

## API endpoints available in M1

M1 ships the config-only part of the API. Everything else (uploads, runs, models, artefacts) arrives in
M2–M4.

| Method | Path | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | `{"status": "ok", "version": "0.1.0"}` (DEC-024) |
| `GET` | `/industries` | the industry template: lifecycle stages in order, their use cases, and the legend |
| `GET` | `/use-cases/{id}` | the merged config, the advanced-settings schema and the Setup-screen copy |
| `GET` | `/use-cases/{id}/template.csv` | the downloadable CSV template for that use case |
| `GET` | `/use-cases/{id}/template_README.md` | the one-line-per-column description of that template (DEC-024) |

`GET /use-cases/{id}` accepts optional `columns`, `primary_key` and `target` query parameters so the
column widgets in the advanced settings can be populated from the uploaded file.

## Milestone status

| # | Milestone | Definition of done | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Skeleton + configs | Repo layout, `pyproject`, configs load and validate, contracts defined, `make setup` works on a clean machine | **done** |
| M2 | Ingest + validate | All validation checks implemented with tests; `POST /uploads` and `POST /runs` return proper 409 payloads on the broken fixtures | pending |
| M3 | Train flow | Full train on synthetic data produces every artefact; leaderboard, evaluation, decile lift, SHAP reasons are real; registry with champion rule | pending |
| M4 | Score flow | Champion scores a new file; schema mismatch reported by column name; drift computed; bands, suppression, control group applied; `scores.csv` downloadable | pending |
| M5 | UI wired | Prototype screens run against the API end to end with no simulated values; Data/Model/Output pages render from artefacts | pending |
| M6 | Config-only reuse | `payment_propensity` and the Telco churn mapping work by adding YAML only; documented in README | mapping and tests in place; the end-to-end run on the real file is the remaining manual step |
| M7 | Hardening | Cancel, error states, large-file handling, logging, `docs/` complete | pending |

## Public dataset smoke test

Plan section 10 asks for one public dataset mapped onto the engine **by configuration only**, as the
proof that config-only reuse is real rather than aspirational. That dataset is the **Kaggle Telco
Customer Churn** file, and the mapping is [`configs/use_cases/telco_churn.yaml`](configs/use_cases/telco_churn.yaml).
Nothing under `engine/` or `api/` was added, changed or branched for it.

### Where to get the data

Download **Telco Customer Churn** (BlastChar's copy of the IBM sample) from
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn>. The download is a single file,
`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: 7,043 subscribers, 21 columns, one row per subscriber. It is
deliberately **not** committed here and no test downloads it — `tests/unit/test_config_only_reuse.py`
synthesises a frame with the same header, value vocabularies and dtypes instead.

### What to map

Nothing. Do not rename a column, derive a flag or pre-clean the file — that is the point of the
exercise. The YAML names the columns the file already has:

| The file | The config | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `customerID` | `template` role `primary_key`, and `primary_key_hints` | identifies the row, never a feature |
| `Churn`, holding `Yes` / `No` | `target.column`, with `target.positive_label: "Yes"` | plan section 4.1: a binary target may carry any two labels, not only `0`/`1` |
| the other 19 columns | `template` role `feature` | `SeniorCitizen` and `tenure` are whole numbers, `MonthlyCharges` a decimal, the rest categorical text |
| *(no date column)* | `split.type` stays `random_stratified` | there is nothing to order the rows by, so a time-based split is not offered |
| *(no consent or contact column)* | `actions.suppression.opt_out_column` and `recently_contacted_column` set to `null` | the public file carries no marketing consent or contact history; the suppression switches stay on and simply have nothing to act on |

`TotalCharges` is blank for a subscriber whose `tenure` is 0, so a plain `read_csv` reads it as text;
the engine's own ingest parses it to a number and leaves those cells missing.

The template for this mapping is generated from the YAML like every other one — never hand-written:

```bash
make generate     # or: python -m scripts.gen_templates
```

It lands in [`templates/telco_churn_template.csv`](templates/telco_churn_template.csv) and its
`_README.md`. The example rows in it show the file's format; they are not rows of the Kaggle file.

### What to expect

The automated half of the smoke test runs in a second and needs no download:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_config_only_reuse.py -q
```

It builds a frame with the dataset's exact columns and dtypes, loads the use case through the real
config loader, and puts it through the real validate stage. Expect:

- **no validation errors**, so `POST /runs` would accept the upload rather than refuse it with a 409;
- **one warning**: `PII_DETECTED` on `gender`. The PII name detector reads `Female` / `Male` as personal
  names. It is a warning, it is acknowledgeable, and `engine/stages/prepare.py` does not redact the
  column, so the run is unaffected. It is a known false positive on this dataset, pinned by the test so
  that any *second* warning has to be explained;
- **19 features**, with no column dropped and none redacted, and a stratified train/validation/test
  split in which all three parts carry both `Yes` and `No`.

The manual half is the end-to-end run: download the file, open **Telecom → Churn → Telco Customer
Churn**, upload the CSV, pick `customerID` and `Churn`, keep every default, and Run. What comes back is
the leaderboard, the evaluation, the decile lift table and the comparison against the logistic baseline
the engine trains alongside the model — all of them computed from that run. **No score from this
dataset is quoted here, and none should be written down anywhere in the product until a real run has
produced it** (plan section 13.3). The bar the smoke test sets is that the run completes on config
alone and beats its own baseline, not that it reaches a particular number.

M6's other half, `payment_propensity`, already works the same way; the test asserts that neither use
case is named anywhere under `engine/` or `api/`.

## Decisions

Every choice that `plan.md` does not make is recorded in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) as a
`DEC-` entry with its context, decision and consequences. M1 opens the log with DEC-001 … DEC-040; later
milestones append. See also [`docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md`](docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md) for the shape of the upload
and [`docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md) for the Phase 4 notes.
