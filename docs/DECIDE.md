# Plan J — deciding better and proving better

**Owner:** Plan J (`docs/plans/MARKETING_AI_PLAN_J_PRODUCT.md`, milestones M90–M111)
**Decisions:** DEC-1300 … DEC-1399 in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md)
**Status:** created by M90 as a skeleton; each milestone fills in its own section in the same change as the code
it describes, and marks it written in §3's table. A section §3 lists as "not yet written" describes nothing yet.

## 1. Purpose

Plan J makes the product good at the two things a marketer pays for before any integration: **deciding** who to
contact with which offer on which channel, and **proving** what the campaign earned. This page is where a reader
learns how, in plain words and with the numbers each result comes from. Until integration, the hand-off is a file
the user downloads (the treat list).

## 2. Where Plan J's code lives

`engine/holdout/`, `engine/measurement/`, `engine/decide/` (error codes in `codes.py`), `api/routes/{campaigns,holdout,measurement}.py`,
`ui/modules/decide/`, `configs/decide/`, `tests/**/{holdout,measurement,decide}/`, `tests/statistical/`. See `PARALLEL_WORK_PROTOCOL.md` §3.

## 4. Running the statistical suite

`make test-statistical` runs `tests/statistical/` (marker `statistical`). `make test` and `make test-all` never
collect it: `tests/statistical/conftest.py` ignores the directory's test files unless `MARKETING_AI_STATISTICAL=1`
(DEC-1300 (e)). The nightly workflow runs it. The tests use fixed seeds and bands of four Monte Carlo standard errors.
This paragraph is the only section M90 writes beyond the skeleton.

## 8. The campaign record, the measurement path and the test plan (M94, DEC-1304)

**A campaign is the list going out.** A scoring run makes a list; `POST /campaigns {run_id,
treatment_start?, bands?, outcome_window_days?, name?}` (Analyst) records that it was sent, and when.
The record (`engine.measurement.campaign.Campaign`, kind `scored`; `external` is reserved for M103)
lives in the platform database (`campaign`, alembic `0006`) and its files under `campaigns/<id>/`:

| File | What it holds | Privacy |
|---|---|---|
| `campaign.json` | a copy of the record: ids, counts, dates, column names | none (no customer id) |
| `assignment.parquet` | per scored customer: the key, `arm` (treated, holdout, suppressed), `intended`, `band`, `segment` and `explore` when the run has them | row-level: erasure, retention |
| `outcomes.parquet` | the key, the outcome and the optional treatment date, copied from the upload | row-level: erasure, retention |
| `incrementality_report.json` | the measured report | aggregate |
| `test_plan.json`, `test_plan_v<n>.json` | the plan in force, and every version | aggregate |

`intended` is the population both arms are compared inside: an uplift run's `intended_treatment`, a
propensity run's treat bands, or every eligible customer (intent to treat). The **treatment start** is
the day the campaign went out, entered by the person (never before the run finished), else the run's
finish time; maturity dates count from it.

**One measurement path.** `engine.measurement.measure.measure_campaign` is the only function that
turns an assignment and an outcomes file into an `IncrementalityReport`: a wrapper over
`engine.uplift.incrementality.measure_incrementality` (the numbers) and `engine.uplift.measure
.campaign_verdict` (the plain verdict, through `campaign_verdict_for`). `POST
/runs/{id}/campaign-results` calls it with the run's scores and no plan, so its reports are what they
were; `POST /campaigns/{id}/measure` calls it with the assignment and the plan in force. `as_of`
always comes from the caller; the route defaults it to now and refuses a later one (`422
CAMPAIGN_INVALID`, path `as_of`), since a moment that has not happened would call open outcome windows
closed and an early look final. A campaign is never measured on part of its customers: while any
outcome window is open the answer is `409 CAMPAIGN_NOT_MATURED` with `results_available_on`, and
nothing is stored.

**The registered test plan.** `POST /campaigns/{id}/plan` (Analyst) freezes a `TestPlan` - metric,
outcome column and kind, optional covariate, outcome window, analysis date and secondary dates, the
detectable effect and expected rate, and from the assignment the holdout share and the customers in
each arm - with `plan_hash`, the SHA-256 of its content. The audit event's `after_hash` is
`content_hash(plan)` and its details carry `plan_hash`. The same plan again returns the stored one; a
different one is `409 TEST_PLAN_EXISTS`; `POST /campaigns/{id}/plan/amendments {reason, ...}` writes
version n+1 with `amends`, every version kept (`GET /campaigns/{id}/plan`); once a final result has
been read the plan can no longer be amended (`409 TEST_PLAN_INVALID`). When an effect and a rate
are given, the power of the planned arms is computed with M93's `engine.measurement.planner.achieved_power`; below
the plan's power the plan carries `PLAN_UNDERPOWERED`, a warning that never blocks. At measurement any
difference from the plan - holdout share, population, window, outcome column, value or kind,
covariate - is `409 TEST_PLAN_CHANGED`. The covariate defaults to the plan's, so only a different one
named in the body is a change. The population allows for erasure: the planned population less a few
customers (neither arm larger, at most 1 % of it and at least one customer gone) is the planned one,
and beyond that the holdout share is compared within half a point. A read before `analysis_date` is
an **early look**: the report says so (`early_look`), its summary gives only the rates and group sizes
so far and the date the result is read - never the conclusion - and no verdict is given.

**Which way round.** The campaign page judges the outcome exactly as step 4 does: a column found in
the outcomes file is the use case's own outcome (for a churn use case, one to prevent), a column the
person named (`CampaignOutcomes.outcome_named`) is judged by its own name, and the verdict uses the use
case's outcome words.

**The value view** (`engine.pilot.roi.compute_roi`) reads a campaign's final report first - the one
named, else the run's latest - and never prices an early look.

**On screen.** Results lists the campaigns beside the runs (a results list registered through the
router's PLAN-J seam); a campaign's page (`#/campaigns/<id>`) shows its result and the "Plan the test"
card with the server's values only.

**Wired at M94's integration, once M92 and M93 had merged (DEC-1304 (l), (m)).**

* *Plan preview (M93).* `GET /campaigns/{campaign_id}/plan-preview?holdout=&base_rate=` (Viewer) in
  `api/routes/campaigns.py` passes the assignment's `realised_population(...)` (its measured
  population, and its explore share) to M93's `engine.measurement.planner.power_preview` at each
  control-group share asked for, or at a fixed ladder (2 % to 50 %) plus the campaign's own realised
  share when none is asked. The rate is the request's, else the registered plan's, else unknown (every
  smallest change is then null with the planner's sentence); the direction is the use case's aim (`down`
  for an outcome to prevent); value and costs are optional query parameters. The answer is
  `{eligible, n_treat, n_holdout, holdout_fraction, base_rate, base_rate_source, direction, points,
  current_index, basis}`: computed points only, nothing stored. `freeze_plan` takes `achieved_power`
  from `planner.achieved_power` (the same test as `engine.uplift.power.power_of_lift`; they differ only
  by the far tail in very small groups). The card's slider (`ui/modules/decide/plan.js`) is a range input
  over the indices of `points`, starting on `current_index`; moving it repaints the readout only, and a
  rate typed into the form asks the route again (DEC-1204). The stop does not change the plan: the
  campaign's split is already drawn. Tests: `tests/integration/measurement/test_plan_preview.py` and the
  jsdom slider tests in `campaigns.test.mjs`.
* *Holdout epochs (M92).* `POST /campaigns` records the run's holdout - `holdout_scope`,
  `holdout_scope_key`, `holdout_epoch` - from its `holdout_assignment.json`
  (`engine.holdout.assign.run_holdout_spec`; a run that wrote none drew per run, scope `run`). `POST
  /campaigns/{id}/measure` refuses `409 CAMPAIGN_EPOCH_MISMATCH` (audited, nothing stored) when
  `engine.measurement.campaign.epoch_mismatch` finds the campaign's runs in two epochs, the run's epoch
  no longer the recorded one, or the persistent holdout redrawn (a later epoch in the ledger `GET
  /holdout` reads) before the outcomes were all in - the end of the outcome window, or the measurement's
  own moment when there is no window or the dates are per row. A redraw after that is fine. The ledger
  keeps only the current epoch's start, so two or more epochs since are refused: when the first began is
  not known. Tests: `tests/unit/measurement/test_campaign_epochs.py`,
  `tests/integration/measurement/test_campaign_epochs.py`.
* *Still open:* `assignment.parquet` does not yet take its explore flag and probability from the run's
  `holdout_assignment.parquet` (a run's `scores.*` carries no explore flag), so a campaign's `n_explore`
  is 0 until that is joined on the key.
