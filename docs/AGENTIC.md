# Agents that check: Plan K

**Owner:** Plan K (`engine/agentic/**`, `engine/compliance/**`, `api/mcp/**`, `api/routes/agentic.py`,
`ui/modules/agentic/**`, `configs/agentic/**`, `tests/**/{agentic,compliance,mcp}/**`, this file).
**Decisions:** DEC-1400 … DEC-1499 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. **Plans:** `docs/plans/MARKETING_AI_PLAN_K_PROPOSAL.md`
(what and why) and `docs/plans/PLAN_K_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` (how).

---

## 1. In plain words

An agent - ours, or another company's connected over MCP (M133) - may **look** and **suggest**. It looks
through *tools*: typed functions over numbers the product has already worked out (a test's size, who may be
contacted, what a campaign measured). It suggests through *proposals*: "register this test plan", "send this
list by email". A proposal is checked against the deployment's rules by the server, and it becomes real only
when a person with the Approver role approves it. Everything - each look, each suggestion, each refusal, each
approval - is written to a ledger that cannot be edited without it showing.

Everything here is switched off by default (`configs/agentic/agentic.yaml`, `agentic.enabled: false`). Off,
the product is exactly what it was before Plan K: no route, no table, no file.

## 2. The five invariants

Every Plan K change keeps these, and a test enforces each one (design §0).

| # | Invariant | Enforced by | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | No tool can write outside our storage or send anything. | `ToolKind` has `read` and `propose` only; `ToolRegistry.register` refuses anything else. | `tests/unit/agentic/test_registry.py::test_there_is_no_write_kind`, `::test_every_registered_tool_reads_or_proposes`, `::test_the_registry_refuses_a_write_tool_and_other_lax_tools` |
| I2 | Every number a person or another agent sees comes from a deterministic tool result. | Tools read stored artefacts and never call a language model; results carry a content-hash `evidence_id`. M139 adds the claim verifier (design §4). | `test_registry.py::test_the_evidence_id_is_a_content_hash`, `tests/agentic/test_read_tools.py` |
| I3 | Nothing becomes real without a person; limits are enforced by the server. | Proposal → default-deny policy → `engine.approvals.decide_proposal` (Approver, re-checked) → the product's own route function. | `tests/unit/agentic/test_policy.py`, `tests/agentic/test_proposal_routes.py` |
| I4 | The holdout cannot be shrunk, skipped or reassigned by any agent path. | `holdout.immutable`, plus the holdout service's own epoch and fingerprint checks (DEC-1302). | `test_policy.py::test_each_rule_refuses_with_its_code[holdout …]`, the `*holdout*` scenarios |
| I5 | Every proposal, approval, refusal and evidence label is on a tamper-evident record. | `engine.agentic.ledger`: hash-chained, signed, verified by `python -m engine.agentic.ledger verify`. | `tests/unit/agentic/test_ledger.py` |

## 3. The tool registry (`engine/agentic/registry.py`, `tools.py`; M132)

A tool is an `AgentTool`: a snake_case `name`, a `kind` (`read` or `propose`), an input model that refuses
unknown fields, an output model, the `RoutePolicy` of the HTTP route that serves the same data (`mirrors`;
a test checks the two are identical, so an agent never sees more than the person could), an evidence label
(`Causal`, `Estimated`, `Not proven`, `Descriptive`) and `run`, a thin wrapper over an existing engine function.

`ToolRegistry.call(name, input, ctx)`:

1. refuses an unknown tool (`TOOL_UNKNOWN`), a principal without the route's role (`TOOL_ROLE_REQUIRED`) and an
   input its model refuses (`TOOL_INPUT_INVALID`; ids are letters, digits, `_` and `-`, so no id names a path);
2. runs the tool and validates the output; more than 16 KB of canonical JSON is refused
   (`TOOL_OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE`): aggregates only, a row never leaves a tool;
3. returns a `ToolResult` whose `evidence_id` is `"ev_" + sha256(canonical([tool, input, output]))[:16]` - the
   same question on the same artefacts is the same id - and writes `evidence.label` to the ledger, signed.

| Tool | Kind | Reads (computed once, never again) | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan_test` | read | `engine.measurement.planner.power_preview` (counts only) | `POST /measurement/power-preview` (Viewer) |
| `check_contactable` | read | the scoring run's `channel_contactability.json`: per channel, contactable and not-contactable counts, reasons as codes (`not_contactable`, and M131's `inquiry_lapsed`, `legacy_unregistered` when the run wrote them; `column_missing`) | `GET /runs/{run_id}/artefacts/{name}` (Viewer, audited) |
| `value_segment` | read | the run's `expected_gross_value.json` (M97), overall or one band; labelled "not incremental" | `GET /runs/{run_id}/artefacts/{name}` (Viewer, audited) |
| `measure` | read | the campaign's stored `incrementality_report.json` (M94's one measurement path); never measures again | `GET /campaigns/{campaign_id}` (Viewer) |
| `audit_campaign` | read | the campaign's stored `audit.json` and report (M103) | `GET /campaigns/{campaign_id}` (Viewer) |
| `get_proof_pack` | read | `engine.pilot.proof.build_proof` (M104), in short: the claim, the headline, each section's traced figures; its build time is left out | `GET /pilot/proof/{campaign_id}` (Viewer) |
| `evaluate_policy` | read | the run's stored `ope_report.json` and `risk_comparison.json` (M96; M137's rollout bound when present) | `GET /runs/{run_id}/risk-comparison` (Viewer) |
| `draft_test_plan` | propose | `engine.measurement.plan.freeze_plan` in dry mode over the campaign's assignment | `POST /campaigns/{campaign_id}/plan` (Analyst) |

Something not computed yet is answered with `null` and a plain sentence saying which route computes it, never
with a 0. Adding a tool means a registry entry, its `RoutePolicy`, tests through the product's routes and, from
M133, the MCP surface test - in one change.

## 4. The policy (`engine/agentic/policy.py`, `configs/agentic/policy.yaml`; M132)

A rule is a pure function `(ProposalSubject, PolicyContext) -> Decision | None`. The context is computed by the
server from stored artefacts (`build_context`), never taken from the payload when the server can compute it:
the use case's holdout and the holdout ledger's epoch, the M108 cost estimate and cap, the scoring run's
per-channel contactability, the arbitration caps (`configs/decide/arbitration.yaml`), the campaign's frozen test
plan and, at approval, the approver. Prompts never reach the policy.

**Default deny.** A kind with no rule set is refused (`POLICY_NO_RULES`); a payload not shaped as its kind is
refused (`POLICY_PAYLOAD_INVALID`); otherwise every rule of the set is evaluated and the proposal is allowed only
when every one that applies allows it. A refusal lists every rule it breaks, with counts (never a customer).

| Rule | Refuses (code) |
|---|---|
| `holdout.immutable` | a campaign plan holding back less than the share in force (the configured share, or the epoch's when larger, less `holdout.tolerance`), `scope: run` on a persistent holdout, held-out customers treated, or no holdout; a test plan whose campaign holds nobody back or that asks for another share than the assignment's (`POLICY_HOLDOUT_IMMUTABLE`) |
| `budget.cap` | the M108 estimate above `governance.max_run_cost_usd`, or unpriced while a cap is set (an agent cannot confirm a cost); offers above `uplift.policy.total_budget`; contacts above `uplift.policy.budget_contacts` (`POLICY_BUDGET_CAP`) |
| `consent.channel` | more customers on the run's list not contactable on the channel than `consent.max_not_contactable` (0), or a channel the run did not record (`POLICY_CONSENT_CHANNEL`) |
| `frequency.cap` | more contacts per customer than `contact_cap_per_customer`, or more on the channel than its `channel_caps` entry (`POLICY_FREQUENCY_CAP`) |
| `test.registered` | no frozen test plan for the campaign, or not the one cited (`POLICY_TEST_NOT_REGISTERED`) |
| `role.separation` | at approval, the person it was proposed for approving it (`POLICY_ROLE_SEPARATION`); `engine.approvals.separation_refusal`, so with sign-in off (one operator holding every role) it cannot be enforced, as for models |

Rule sets at launch: `test_plan: [holdout.immutable, role.separation]`; `campaign_plan:` all six. `copy_arms`
(M140) has none, so it is refused. The policy version is the sha256 of `policy.yaml`, written into every ledger
entry, so a past decision can be re-checked against the rules in force when it was made.

## 5. Proposals and their approval (`engine/agentic/proposals.py`, `engine/approvals.py`; M132)

```
draft (agent) ─policy─► refused (codes, on the ledger)
             └────────► pending ─person─► approved ─► executed by the product's own route function
                                  ├─────► rejected
                                  └─────► expired (no decision within proposals.expire_after_days, 14)
```

A `Proposal` holds `kind`, `payload` (canonical JSON), `evidence_ids` (each one must be on the ledger), the
policy's decisions, `payload_digest` (`sha256(canonical(payload))`, the pass^k key), the status, who it was
proposed for and by which agent, the policy version and its expiry. It is stored at
`agentic/proposals/<id>.json`: ids, counts and the plan's own words, never a customer row.

`draft_test_plan` computes the plan `freeze_plan` would freeze for the campaign now - the outcome window resolved
and the analysis date checked as the plan route does - and proposes it with its `plan_hash`. Nothing is
registered.

`engine.approvals.decide_proposal` is the second decision kind beside model decisions (`DECISION_SUBJECTS`). On
approve it checks the proposal is pending and not expired, re-runs the policy with the facts as they are now and
the approver in the context (`role.separation`), refuses a test plan whose dry hash has changed
(`PROPOSAL_STALE`), and then calls the executor the caller passes: the `/agentic` route passes
`api.routes.campaigns.register_plan`, the function `POST /campaigns/{id}/plan` runs, so a plan registered
meanwhile is refused exactly as there (`409 TEST_PLAN_EXISTS`). An agent never gets a second path to anything.

| Method and path | Role | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /agentic/proposals` | Viewer | Every proposal, newest first; `?status=` narrows. |
| `GET /agentic/proposals/{proposal_id}` | Viewer | One proposal with its evidence ids and decisions. |
| `POST /agentic/proposals/{proposal_id}/approve` | Approver, audited | `{reason?}`. 200 with the receipt (`ledger_checkpoint`: the ledger head after the approval; keep it). 403 `POLICY_ROLE_SEPARATION`, 409 `POLICY_*`, `PROPOSAL_STALE`, `PROPOSAL_EXPIRED`, `PROPOSAL_NOT_PENDING`, `PROPOSAL_NOT_EXECUTABLE` (a campaign plan: nothing carries one out until M139; it stays pending), the executing route's own code; 404 `PROPOSAL_NOT_FOUND`. |
| `POST /agentic/proposals/{proposal_id}/reject` | Approver, audited | `{reason?}`. 200 with the receipt. |

There is no route that drafts or approves for an agent; the routes exist only while `agentic.enabled` is on.

## 6. The decision ledger (`engine/agentic/ledger.py`; M132)

`agentic_decision_log` (platform database; Alembic `0009_agentic_ledger`): `seq`, `prev_hash`, `entry_hash`,
`kind`, `actor`, `body`, `signature`, `key_id`, `created_at`.

* `entry_hash = sha256(prev_hash ‖ canonical({seq, kind, actor, created_at, body}))`, so any edited field breaks
  the chain at that entry, and a re-hashed forgery breaks the next link or its signature.
* Kinds: `proposal.drafted`, `proposal.refused`, `proposal.approved`, `proposal.rejected`, `proposal.expired`,
  `approval.refused`, `proposal.execution_failed`, `test_plan.frozen` (with the campaign's holdout scope, epoch
  and salt id: the holdout commitment), `evidence.label`. Approvals, frozen test plans and evidence labels are
  signed over `entry_hash`.
* `Signer` protocol: `FileKeySigner` (Ed25519, `cryptography`, already pinned; `<data dir>/agentic/
  ledger_signing_key.pem`, created once with 0600 permissions), `FakeSigner` for tests; AWS KMS on client
  deployments later (design §3.2, open question 2).
* A body holds only the keys in `BODY_KEYS` (ids, digests, codes, labels, the policy version) with scalar
  values: an approver's reason is kept as its digest. Erasure never touches the ledger.
* `python -m engine.agentic.ledger verify [--data-dir DIR] [--key PATH]` walks the chain in batches (linear in
  the entries) and checks every signature; on the first bad entry it prints `LEDGER_CHAIN_BROKEN` or
  `LEDGER_SIGNATURE_INVALID` with its `seq` and exits 1.
* Appending is one short Core transaction (about 1.5 ms on SQLite after warm-up; design budget 5 ms). Verifying
  costs about 22 µs per unsigned entry (a million in about 22 s, inside the design's 30 s budget) and about
  150 µs per signed one, almost all of it the Ed25519 check (a million signed entries in about 2.5 minutes),
  measured on the shared 4-CPU build machine. Evidence labels are signed and are the most numerous kind, so a
  deployment with millions of them needs checkpointed verification (verify from the last good head) before the
  30 s budget holds; that is follow-up work, not M132's.

## 7. Evaluation: scenarios, pass^k and the mutation test (`engine/agentic/evals.py`; M132)

A scenario is `(fixture world, request, expected outcome)` (`tests/agentic/scenarios/`). The world is built by
the product's own code: an uplift model trained and a campaign file scored through `Pipeline`, with SMS and
email consent columns; campaigns created and a test plan registered through the API; a copied configuration root
with an offer budget, a cost cap, arbitration caps and a persistent holdout on a second use case.

* **pass^k**: every scenario runs ten times; it passes only when the ten outcomes (status, codes, payload digest)
  are identical and match the expectation. The harness takes an `LLMClient` (`FakeLLMClient` in CI) and records
  its model id; M132 has no model step, so it is not called and the cost is zero.
* **Mutation test**: each policy rule is removed in turn; at least one scenario - in particular the ones written
  to guard it - must then fail. With every rule removed a kind is still refused (default deny).
* The report is `EvalReport`, written by `write_report` as canonical JSON (`reports/agentic_eval.json` by default).
